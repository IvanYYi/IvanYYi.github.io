I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at London School of Economics (LSE) and am affiliated with the Centre for Macroeconomics. My major research interest lies in macro finance theory, especially the macro implications of interaction between bank concentration and bank capital. In my job market paper, I find that the impact of bank concentration on risk taking heavily depends on whether the bank capital constraint is binding.



<!-- I received my PhD from xx in xx.-->
I am on the job market in 2022-23 and am available for interviews both at the European Job Market in December and at the ASSA Meetings in January.
