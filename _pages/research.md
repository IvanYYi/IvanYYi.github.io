  *Abstract: How does bank capital affect the relationship between bank concentration and risk taking? I develop a tractable dynamic model with heterogeneous financially constrained entrepreneurs and an imperfectly competitive banking sector. Based on the model, when the bank capital ratio exceeds the minimum requirement, intensifying bank competition leads to fragility; otherwise, no significant correlation is observed. To explain the equilibrium characterization, I propose two mechanisms, a risk shifting mechanism and a net margin mechanism, the direction of which will be determined by the banks' optimal decisions on the loan rate and the accumulation of excess bank capital. The two forces also jointly determine a non-monotonic relationship between bank concentration and efficiency. I discuss how efficiency and stability can be enhanced simultaneously.*

* [Bank Concentration, Bank Capital, and Misallocation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4046630). 
  
  *Abstract: U.S. bank concentration, together with the bank capital, have been rising over the last thirty years. Based on the stylized facts, I develop a tractable dynamic model with heterogeneous financially constrained entrepreneurs and an imperfectly competitive banking sector. The model implies that increasing bank concentration leads to an increase in bank capital and a possibly non-binding capital constraint. I use the model to understand how bank concentration affects misallocation through the interaction between bank concentration and bank capital when the financial market is incomplete, which I refer to as the "bank capital channel". This channel suggests that banks over-accumulate equity capital in terms of allocative efficiency, based on which I discuss implications on regulations.*
